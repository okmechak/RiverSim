    Main incorporates user commands handling and managing of inner simulation objects.
    User commands are simple terminal commands(run ./riversim --help to check them all).
    It setups initial conditions and parameters. Initializes all object that are used in
    simulation like: Geometry, Mesh, Triangle and Simualtion, which are all combined
    into the loop.
    Please review code for further details

    \section introduction Introduction
    
    __Here you can find information about RiverSim program. From detailed description to general use cases__.
   
    __RiverSim__ - is simulation of river network growth C++ program, using model based on Laplace equation.
  
    Mathematicaly, program solves Partial Differential Equation(PDE) using Finite Element Method(FEM). Solving of PDE involves setting up boundaries, mesh generation, building a linear system and finaly solution. 
  
    All these steps are done by using different open source C++ libraries: _Triangle_, _Tethex_ and  _Deal.II_, which are combined in one program - __RiverSim__.

    __Here is video demonstration of simulation:__

    \section githubrepo Github Repository and Installation
    
    See [README](https://github.com/okmechak/RiverSim) on github repository for deatailed installation instruction.

    \section illustrations Illustrations
    
    This illustration represents geometrical structure of program and how geometry relates to classes,
    and how classes relates between each other.

    Main geometry classes of program are next:

    + River::Polar
    + River::Point
    + River::Boundary
    + River::BranchNew
    + River::Rivers

    \section workflow Program Cycle Workflow

    Steps: 

    + First step is to initialize program. This can be accomplished specifing program options
        or input file(\ref io.hpp).
    + 2,3 initialization on model geometry and model parameters.
    + 4 - Triangulation process is started(see \ref mesh.hpp)
        Mesh and boundary files are produced.
    + 5 - PDE solver based on Deal.II library(see \ref solver.hpp)
        VTK file is produced.
    + 6 - Integration of series parameters near tip points(see River::Solver::integrate())
    + 7 - Modification of tree: adding new points to tips. In other words - river growth process.
        At this stage JSON file is produced with current river network state.
    + Proces repeats from step 4, until River::StopConditionOfRiverGrowth is fired or sucessifull
        number of steps is reached.

    \section futherreading Futher Reading
    
    + Take a look into [File List](files.html). Some more important for understanding files:
        + \ref experiments
        + \ref GeometryPrimitives.hpp
        + \ref boundary.hpp
        + \ref tree.hpp
        + \ref physmodel.hpp
        + \ref io.hpp
    + Next you can overview Classes from those files.
    + For any suggestions or improvments create [issue](github.com/okmechak/RiverSim/issues) on github repo

    \section basicusage Basic Program Usage

    As any Linux program, type in terminal from folder source(in your build folder) command:
    > ./riversim

    More details about parameters you can find in __help__ of program:
    > ./riversim -h
    or
    > ./riversim --help
    
    Typical forward river simulation command:
    > ./riversim -n 100 -o simdata

    And after that, typical backward simulation commnad:
    > ./riversim -n 130 -o revsim --simulation-type=1 simdata.json
